                <h2>Gluten Free Cinnamon Rolls</h2>
                <img src = "images/Gluten-Free-Cinnamon-Rolls.jpg" alt = "">
                <p>Yes, you can be gluten free and have your cinnamon rolls too! Gluten Free Cinnamon Rolls are sweet, fluffy, and made from pantry staples. Meet your new go to recipe.</p>
                <h3>Best Tips for Making Gluten Free Cinnamon Rolls</h3>
                <p>Now, baking regular cinnamon rolls from scratch can be intimidating – baking gluten free cinnamon rolls can be even more so. That said, after making countless batches of these cinnamon rolls, here are my best notes and tips. Be sure to read the post text for additional helpful tips:

                  Make sure your yeast AND baking powder are fresh and not expired, which will affect the successful rise of the rolls.
                  Don’t be surprised by the texture of the cinnamon roll dough. It’s like a very soft play dough vs pliable and stretchy like regular cinnamon roll dough. Be extra gentle with it.
                  Don’t roll the dough too thin otherwise it will fall apart. This is the #1 thing to keep in mind to successfully get the rolls into the pan.
                  If your unbaked rolls look hideous, it’s fine! They’ll taste delicious and are going to be slathered in icing anyway. You should have seen my first few batches.
                  You CAN prep these gluten free cinnamon rolls a day ahead of time. Please see the recipe card for timing instructions.’
                  I cannot guarantee your results will be exactly like mine if you use a different flour blend than the one pictured here. 
                  Alrighty – ready to do this?!</p>

                <h2>One Pot Chicken and Rice</h2>
                <img src = "images/One-Pot-Chicken-and-Rice.jpeg" alt = "">
                <p>We affectionately call One Pot Chicken and Rice “gruel” at my house.

                  “KIDS!” I’ll yell at dinnertime, “Come get yer gruel!” and they come running. What can I say, it makes me laugh and it’s the little things.
                  
                  This easy, gluten free recipe was born from Lincoln’s love of Easy Chicken and Rice Soup and Cam’s deep desire to wear his dinner every night. Part risotto (without all the stirring) and part soup, this creamy chicken and rice recipe is simple and comforting, made in one pot, and easy enough for a 2 year old to eat. Lucky for you and me, it tastes nothing like gruel!</p>

                  <p>One Pot Chicken and Rice
                    Sliced carrots are sauteed in butter and homemade seasoned salt then simmered with dried minced onions and garlic, white rice, diced chicken, and rich chicken stock until thick and irresistible. THEN it’s finished with a couple pats of butter. Did I mention it’s irresistable? This recipe makes enough to feed a crowd and anything we don’t finish reheats wonderfully, too. It is not an understatement to say that my entire family LOVES this dish!</p>

                <h2>Pink Sauce Pasta</h2>
                <img src = "images/Pink-Sauce-Pasta.jpeg" alt = "">
                <p>Switch up pasta night with Pink Sauce Pasta! This decadent, 10 minute, 3 ingredient pasta recipe will leave you licking your plate clean.</p>
                <h3>Why Pink Sauce Pasta?</h3>
                <p> Pink Sauce Pasta is cooked pasta tossed with equal parts red marinara sauce and white alfredo sauce which combine to make – you got it – a pink-hued sauce. Again, as simple as the combination sounds, it is mind blowingly delicious. I’m sort of wondering how I’m ever supposed to go back to eating pasta with plain ol’ marinara sauce? Each bite tastes like you’re eating cheese ravioli – you will lick your plate clean!</p>

                <h2>ACAI BOWL</h2>
                <img src = "images/Acai-Bowl-4-1.jpg" alt = "">
                <p>Acai bowls are the quintessential smoothie bowl. Especially in Southern California where you can find them in nearly every beach town. But even if you’re not close to a healthy beach cafe, you can easily make them at home (hooray). Let me show you how.</p>
                <p>Yes, when eaten in moderation. The dark purple color of acai is an indicator that it’s loaded with polyphenols and anthocyanins (a flavonoid pigment also found in beets, blackberries and blueberries) and packed full of antioxidants.

                  In fact, acai has the highest level of anthocyanins which is why some consider it a superfood. Even more, its loaded with vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium and fiber. That’s why it’s one of my favorite anti-inflammatory foods to enjoy.
                  
                  But when it comes to acai bowls, there’s a large quantity of fruit, not only from the acai but also from the toppings. That means acai bowls can have a significant amount of sugar. And while it’s natural fruit sugar, it’s still something to be aware of. So enjoy your smoothie bowl, but in moderation.</p>
